# /status use-cases

Here are some scenarios where the information from the `/status` file of the
Resiliate filesystem can be invaluable:

## 1. **User Behavior Analysis**

**Problem**: A sysadmin wants to monitor user behavior to detect any
unusual activities that might indicate compromised accounts or
insider threats.

**Solution**: By analyzing the `/status` file, the sysadmin can
track activities of specific users (using the `u:` prefix). For
instance, a sudden spike in damaged files or exfiltrations for a
particular user might indicate suspicious behavior.

**Example**:

```bash
grep "^u:" /status | awk '$3 > 10 {print $0}'
```

This command filters out users with more than 10 damaged files,
which can then be further investigated.

## 2. **Real-time Threat Detection**

**Problem**: A security admin wants to set up real-time alerts for potential threats.

**Solution**: The `/threats` file can be monitored for changes. Any
new entries can trigger an alert. Additionally, the `score` and
`sigma` values in the `/status` file can be used to set thresholds
for alerts.

**Example**:

```bash
tail -f /threats | grep "Ransomware"
```

This command monitors the threats file in real-time for any
ransomware-related entries.

## 3. **Data Labeling for Machine Learning**

**Problem**: A data scientist wants to train a machine learning
model to predict malicious activities and needs labeled data.

**Solution**: The `/status` file provides labeled data with
`reason`, `attack`, and `score` fields. This data can be extracted
and used as training data for the model.

**Example**:

```bash
awk -F" " '{print $4, $6, $8}' /status > training_data.csv
```

This command extracts the `reason`, `attack`, and `score` fields for
machine learning training.

## 4. **Impact Detection Post-Incident**

**Problem**: After a security incident, a secadmin wants to assess
the impact, specifically which processes were involved and the
extent of the damage.

**Solution**: The `p:` entries in the `/status` file can be analyzed
to see which processes were active during the incident and how many
files they damaged or exfiltrated.

**Example**:

```bash
grep "^p:" /status | awk '$3 > 0 || $5 > 0 {print $0}'
```

This command lists processes that have damaged or exfiltrated files.

---

## 5. **Forensic Analysis**

**Problem**: After a data breach, forensic experts want to trace
back the activities of a particular group or user to understand the
breach's origin.

**Solution**: The `/status` file can be analyzed to track the
activities of specific groups (using the `g:` prefix) or users over
time.

**Example**:

```bash
grep "^g:1000" /status
```

This command retrieves all activities associated with group ID 1000.

These scenarios highlight the versatility of the Resiliate
filesystem's `/status` and `/threats` files in addressing various
system and security administration challenges. By leveraging this
data, professionals can proactively manage, monitor, and mitigate
potential risks.
