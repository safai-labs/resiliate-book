# CE (Cybernetic Engram Control Engine)

The CE is a dynamic and extensible system designed to enhance threat detection
and response capabilities. It achieves this by leveraging a range of plugins,
each tailored to specific threat detection methodologies. The configuration of
CE and its plugins is managed through a TOML file.

Each filesystem has its own control plane, which is used to interact with the
CE and its plugins. The control plane is located at `/var/lib/resiliate/${mount_dir_flattened}`.

You can find more information about the control plane in the [Control Plane](control-plane/)

## Configuration

Let's go over a sample configuration file for the CE:

```toml
# Main configuration for the Cybernetic Engram Control Engine (CE)
[ce]
# Directory where the compiled plugins are stored.
# Default: The directory where CE is installed.
plugins-dir = "target/debug"

# Directory for the CE control plane.
# Default: /var/lib/resiliate/${mount_dir_flattened}
control-plane-dir = "/tmp/ce"

# Enable or disable enforcement mode
# on | off | auto
enforcement = auto

# Configuration for the 'core' plugin, based on the 'naive' detection methodology.
[core]
# Path to the compiled plugin. This remains constant even if the section name changes.
plugin = "libce_naive.so"

# Directory containing the necessary models for the plugin.
# Default: Directory where the CE is installed.
models-dir = "/usr/share/resiliate/lib"

# Note: The same plugin can be configured multiple times if it supports multiple instances.
# For example, another instance of the 'naive' plugin can be added as:
# [core2]
# plugin = "libce_naive.so"
# models-dir = "/usr/share/resiliate/lib2"
```

The central configuration of the CE is defined under the `[ce]` section:

- `control-plane-dir`: This directory serves as the control plane for the CE.
  By default, the mount point for the CE control plane is
  `/var/lib/resiliate/${mount_dir_flattened}`, but it can be overridden as shown
  in the example with `/tmp/ce`.

- `enforcement`: Whether or not the system will obey enforcement suggestions by
  CE. In enforcement mode, the CE provides mandatory accerss control (MAC) 
  over files, and grants or revokes access to processes, users, and groups.
  The access control based on what the evaluations of the plugins.

- `plugins-dir`: This is the directory where the compiled plugins are stored.
  In the provided example, this is set to `/usr/lib/resiliate/plugins`.
  

## Plugin Configuration

The CE supports multiple plugins, each defined in its section within the TOML file.
The section name determines the control plane subdirectory name for that plugin.
For instance:

- `[core]`: This section configures the `core` plugin, which is based on the
  `libce_naive.so` library.
  - `plugin`: Specifies the path to the compiled plugin. In the example,
    this is set to `libce_naive.so`.
  - `models-dir`: This directory contains the necessary models for the plugin.
    In the example, it's set to `/usr/share/resiliate/lib`.

The control plane subdirectory name is derived from the section name. So, for the
`core` plugin, the corresponding directory in the control plane would be `/core`.

It's worth noting that if a plugin supports it, it can be configured multiple times.
This allows for diverse configurations for different use cases. The `naive`
plugin, for instance, supports this feature.

## Interacting with CE and Its Plugins

1. **Accessing the Control Plane**: Navigate to the control plane root as specified
   in the `control-plane-dir` setting. By default, this would be `/var/lib/resiliate/${mount_dir_flattened}`.

2. **Viewing CE Metrics**: Access the `/status` file within the control plane root
   to view the current state and metrics of the CE. Given its fixed length, you may
   need to re-read this file periodically for updated information.

3. **Monitoring Threats**: The `/threats` file within the control plane root
   provides real-time threat detection from all configured plugins. Like the
   `/status` file, it has a fixed length, so you'll need to re-read it to get
   the latest threat data.

4. **Plugin-specific Interaction**: To interact with a specific plugin, navigate
   to its corresponding subdirectory in the control plane.
   For example, for the `core` plugin, you would go to `/core`.

## Examples

To view the current metrics of the CE:

```bash
cat /var/lib/resiliate/${mount_dir_flattened}/status
```

To check the latest threats detected by all plugins:

```bash
cat /var/lib/resiliate/${mount_dir_flattened}/threats
```
