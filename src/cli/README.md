# Command Line Tool

The `aifs` command-line tool is a fast and scalable data safeguard solution
that includes commands to provide streamlined use for both high-level
operations and low-level access to backend stores and mount points.
Your application data transparently becomes self-healing and self-defending.

The following Sections provide in-depth information on the commands available.

- [`rectify`](rectify.md) - Manage recovery points.
- [`filesystem`](filesystem.md) - Configure AIFS filesystem.
- [`config`](config.md) - Configure AIFS software and services.
- [`storage`](storage.md) - Configure AIFS back-end storage.
