# Integrating with Microsoft Windows

## Prerequisites

Please go through the [Installation](../install/README.md) process
and configure a Resiliate file-server before continuing.

It is recommended that you install Samba on the Linux server using:

``` bash
apt install samba
```

You can use Resiliate with Windows in a variety of ways. There are many
configurations here, please choose the one that works for your
particular use-case.
