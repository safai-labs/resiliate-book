## Using Resiliate as a Simple Network Share

The easiest way to integrate with Microsoft Windows networks is to
simply configure a samba service on your Resiliate file-server with a
selected number of common shares.

This method is also good for creating an environment that will integrate
with LDAP or RADIUS based authentications.

Please make sure that a share drive is available over NFS or Samba.
