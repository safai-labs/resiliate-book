# Getting started

In this section you will learn how to get started using Resiliate
on your system!

> Native windows support is coming soon, meanwhile you can use Samba to
export Resiliate protected partition to your Windows Network. Since all the
protection is built into the file system you don't need any agents on
your Microsoft WindowsÂ® end-points, and still get protection of any
data stored on the Resiliate partition.
