# Analyze

Let's analyze your data!

1. You may go into your created recovery point files and analyze how
    your data looks at a certain point in time.

1. You may also compare the differences between pre and post attacked
   data to determine what files were being targeted.

1. You will notice that the restored data has no traces of the payload.
   Restoring your data with Resiliate is like turning back the clock. It
   does not fix the damaged data it simply removes it from production
   and gives you back your healthy data.
