        4. sāf.ai Trademark License. Subject to Partner\'s compliance
            with the terms and conditions of this PPA, the sāf.ai Brand
            Guidelines, the applicable Addendum, and the Program
            Policies, sāf.ai hereby grants to Partner a royalty-free,
            non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
            non-assignable license, during the Term, to use the sāf.ai
            Marks in the Authorized Locations solely as authorized in
            the Applicable Addendum. Partner shall provide sāf.ai with
            samples of each use of sāf.ai Marks prior to such use and
            shall refrain from all uses that sāf.ai informs Partner are
            detrimental to sāf.ai\'s interests. Partner understands that
            any use of sāf.ai trademarks (e.g., \'sāf.ai AIFS™\') is
            subject to sāf.ai\'s applicable policies, available through
            the Partner Portal, and Partner agrees to strictly adhere to
            such policies. Any use of a sāf.ai Mark by Partner must
            correctly attribute ownership of such mark to sāf.ai and
            must be in accordance with applicable law and sāf.ai\'s
            then-current trademark usage guidelines that have been
            provided or made available to Partner. Partner acknowledges
            and agrees that sāf.ai owns the sāf.ai Marks and that any
            and all goodwill and other proprietary rights that are
            created by or that result from Partner\'s use of a sāf.ai
            Mark hereunder inure solely to the benefit of sāf.ai.
            Partner will at no time contest or aid in contesting the
            validity or ownership of any sāf.ai Mark or take any action
            in derogation of sāf.ai\'s rights therein, including,
            without limitation, applying to register any trademark,
            trade name or other designation that is confusingly similar
            to any sāf.ai Mark. sāf.ai may withdraw its approval of any
            use of sāf.ai Marks at any time in its sole discretion upon
            written notice to Partner, which withdrawal shall be
            effective promptly, provided that no such withdrawal will
            require the recall of any previously published or
            distributed materials that cannot reasonably be recalled.
        5. Partner Trademark License. Partner grants sāf.ai a
            royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
            non-sublicensable, non-assignable license during the Term to
            use, solely for the purpose of identifying and promoting
            Partner\'s participation in the Partner Program or as the
            parties otherwise agree in writing and in connection with
            sāf.ai\'s rights, duties and obligations under this PPA,
            Partner\'s marks including Partner\'s company name, and, if
            applicable, any logos uploaded by Partner to the Partner
            Portal or otherwise provided to sāf.ai by Partner (\"Partner
            Marks\"). Partner may withdraw its approval of any use of
            Partner Marks at any time in its sole discretion upon
            written notice to sāf.ai, which withdrawal shall be
            effective promptly but in no case more than thirty (30) days
            from the date of Partner\'s notice sent in accordance with
            Section 12.5 (Notice) below, provided that no such
            withdrawal will require the recall of any previously
            published or distributed materials.
        6. Additional Restrictions. Without affecting any other
            restrictions set forth in the sāf.ai Terms of Service and
            this PPA, Partner\'s use of any Program Benefits, including
            sāf.ai IP provided to Partner hereunder, is subject to the
            additional restrictions set forth below. Partner may not,
            unless expressly authorized in an Addendum:

            a.  Remove or modify any program markings or any notice of
                sāf.ai or sāf.ai\'s licensors\' proprietary rights;

            b.  Use sāf.ai IP in a manner that misrepresents Partner\'s
                relationship with sāf.ai or is otherwise misleading or
                that reflects negatively on sāf.ai;

            c.  Modify in any way any sāf.ai Offerings or sāf.ai Marks
                (e.g., by inserting Partner\'s company or brand name
                inside sāf.ai logo or otherwise white-labeling or
                co-branding sāf.ai Offerings); or

            d.  Use or duplicate sāf.ai IP provided to Partner for any
                purpose other than as specified in this PPA or make
                sāf.ai IP available to unauthorized third parties.
        7. Feedback. Partner is under no duty to provide any
            suggestions, enhancement requests, or other feedback
            regarding the sāf.ai Offerings (\"Feedback\"). If Partner
            offers Feedback to sāf.ai, Partner hereby grants sāf.ai a
            perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide,
            fully-paid, sub-licensable, assignable license to
            incorporate into the sāf.ai Offerings or otherwise use any
            Feedback sāf.ai receives from Partner.
        8. Prohibition on Competitive Use. Notwithstanding anything to
            the contrary in this PPA or any Addendum, Partner may not
            use any of the sāf.ai Offerings to develop, offer or make
            available a product or service to any third party that could
            reasonably be seen to serve as a substitute for such third
            party\'s possible subscription to any sāf.ai product or
            service, provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed to
            prevent Partner from offering a product or service that (a)
            requires a customer to have an account with sāf.ai for the
            use of sāf.ai Offerings; or (b) utilizes sāf.ai Offerings
            and for which Partner compensates sāf.ai under this PPA.
    4. Security and Safety Policies. Partner\'s personnel must at all
        times observe the security and safety policies of sāf.ai when on
        sāf.ai property and/or any security and safety policies of
        sāf.ai\'s customers that sāf.ai provides from time to time, when
        and if Partner is on such customers\' property.
    5. Compliance with Applicable Laws. Each party shall comply, and
        shall procure that any third parties performing activities on
        party\'s behalf related to this PPA (including without
        limitation sales and referral activities) comply, with all
        applicable foreign and domestic laws, governmental regulations,
        ordinances, and judicial administrative orders, including, but
        not limited to, trademark and copyright laws, ICANN policies and
        procedures governing domain names, the EU General Data
        Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the \"GDPR\"), the United States
        Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1, et seq. (the
        \"FCPA\"), the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 (the \"UK Bribery
        Act\"), and applicable export control laws or regulations
        (collectively \"Applicable Laws\") and shall not engage in any
        deceptive, misleading, illegal or unethical marketing
        activities. Partner shall promptly inform sāf.ai in writing upon
        becoming aware of any violations of Applicable Laws in
        connection with this PPA. In the event that sāf.ai reasonably
        believes that Partner has breached its obligations set forth in
        this Section 4.5, sāf.ai, in its sole discretion, may, upon
        reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours,
        inspect and make copies of Partner\'s books, records, and
        accounts reasonably relevant to the potential breach, which
        shall be deemed to be Partner\'s Confidential Information under
        this Agreement. Such inspection may include interviews of
        relevant Partner personnel.
    6. No Affiliation with Government Officials. Partner represents and
        warrants that no director, employee, direct or indirect owner,
        representative, consultant or agent who is or will be involved
        in Partner\'s activities under this PPA, is a Government
        Official.
    7. Periodic Anti-Bribery Certification. Partner agrees that Partner
        will periodically, but no more frequently than once per year
        unless sāf.ai has a reasonable suspicion that Partner has
        violated Section 4.5 or 4.6, at sāf.ai\'s request, complete
        reasonable due diligence questionnaires and/or certify in
        writing to sāf.ai that Partner has not, and to Partner\'s
        knowledge no other person affiliated with Partner, including but
        not limited to any owner, director, employee, representative and
        agent of Partner has made, offered to make, agreed to make, or
        authorized any payment, loan, donation or gift of money or
        anything else of value, directly or indirectly, to or for the
        benefit of any Government Official, to obtain or retain
        business, or secure any improper advantage.
    8. No Guarantees or Representations. Partner shall not make any
        warranties or guarantees concerning the sāf.ai Offerings, or any
        indemnities on behalf of sāf.ai or on its own behalf relating to
        the provision of the sāf.ai Offerings, and any representations
        made relating to the Services must be entirely consistent with
        the content of the sāf.ai Materials. Partner will not represent
        that it has been authorized by sāf.ai to assume or create any
        express or implied obligation on behalf of sāf.ai or indicate in
        any way that sāf.ai is responsible, in contract or otherwise,
        for any obligation beyond those obligations specifically
        undertaken by sāf.ai in a subscription agreement between sāf.ai
        and a Customer.
    9. Non-Exclusive Arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt, and
        notwithstanding anything else in this PPA or any Addendum, this
        PPA is a non-exclusive arrangement, and neither party shall be
        prevented from pursuing other work or opportunities, including
        competitive opportunities during or after the Term, so long as
        such party does not breach any term of this PPA (including
        without limitation provisions governing confidentiality and
        intellectual property) in pursuing such opportunity.

5. Partner Obligations; Support; Training; Other Services

    1. Generally. Partner\'s personnel who are involved in Partner\'s
        activities under this PPA must be generally knowledgeable about
        sāf.ai and the sāf.ai Offerings and their functionality prior to
        engaging with any Customer in the activities contemplated
        hereunder.
    2. Marketing. Each party shall have the marketing obligations, if
        any, set forth in an applicable Addendum.
    3. Support. The parties shall each be obligated to perform the
        Support services specified in an applicable Addendum.
    4. Partner Identification. Subject to compliance with the terms of
        this PPA, Partner may refer to itself as a \"sāf.ai Partner\"
        (or in such other manner as described in an Addendum) solely
        with respect to the products or services, if any, set forth in
        an applicable Addendum, subject to any requirements sāf.ai
        communicates to Partner on the use of such identifier. For the
        avoidance of doubt, Partner may not, unless otherwise agreed in
        writing by sāf.ai, refer to itself as \"Authorized\"; or
        \"Certified\" or any similar term related to its relationship
        with sāf.ai that might imply sāf.ai stands behind or provides a
        warranty for the workmanship of Partner products or services.
        sāf.ai additionally may, in its sole discretion, offer certain
        courses that may permit Partner to refer to certain of its
        personnel as \"accredited\", \"certified\"; or other term
        following the successful completion of such course, subject to
        any requirements set forth in such course.
    5. Training by sāf.ai. sāf.ai may, in its sole discretion offer
        Training for Partner personnel on the use of sāf.ai Offerings.
        Whether Training is offered for free, at a discount, or at full
        price depends on Partner Tier and Partner Benefits.
    6. Business Practices. Partner will: (i) conduct business in a
        manner that reflects favorably at all times on the sāf.ai
        Offerings and the good name, goodwill and reputation of
        sāf.ai; (ii) make no false or misleading representations with
        regard to sāf.ai or the sāf.ai Offerings; and (iii) make no
        representations, warranties or guarantees with respect to the
        specifications, features or functionality of the sāf.ai
        Offerings that are inconsistent with the literature distributed
        by sāf.ai.

6. Payment; Reporting

    1. Currency. All payments under this PPA shall be made in United
        States Dollars (US\$).
    2. Wire Transfer Fees. Partner may request Referral Fees under the
        PPA be made by wire transfer if it and its bank accounts are
        located outside of the United States. Any wire transfer fees
        owed by the party receiving a wire transfer shall be borne by
        the receiving party; any wire transfer fees owed by the party
        sending a wire transfer shall be borne by the sending party.
    3. Exchange Rates. If any fees under an applicable Addendum are
        calculated on the basis of revenue that is paid other than in US
        Dollars (\$US), the amounts owed shall be calculated on the
        basis of the exchange rates published on
        <http://www.x-rates.com/historical/> on the last day of the
        engagement (or the last day of the month, for ongoing
        engagements paid on a monthly basis) (\"Exchange Rate\").
    4. Expenses. Each party shall cover their own expenses unless
        otherwise specified in an Addendum in which case any such
        expenses shall be appropriately documented.
    5. Taxes. Partner acknowledges and agrees that it is Partner\'s
        sole responsibility to pay all applicable Taxes owed, including
        with respect to any Taxes owed to Partner\'s personnel. Partner
        will indemnify sāf.ai and hold sāf.ai harmless to the extent of
        any obligation imposed by law on sāf.ai to pay any such amounts
        in connection with any payments made by sāf.ai to Partner under
        this PPA on account of Partner\'s or Partner\'s agents or
        employees.
    6. Audit; Reporting. No more than once in any 12-month period
        during the Term, and once following the date of termination or
        expiration of this PPA, sāf.ai at its own expense may audit the
        Partner\'s records for the sole purpose of (i) confirming the
        Partner\'s compliance with the Program Policies, Section 5.6 and
        Section 4.5; (ii) reviewing the use by Partner of any sāf.ai IP
        and any communications made by Partner to a Customer or publicly
        regarding the sāf.ai Offerings; and (iii) any additional
        purposes described in an applicable Addendum. Partner, at its
        own expense during the Term and for two (2) years thereafter,
        will maintain complete and accurate records supporting its
        provision of any Services, the calculation fees, and any Reports
        it submits pursuant to this PPA. Any such audit will be
        conducted during regular business hours at the Partner\'s
        offices and facilities and shall not interfere unreasonably with
        the Partner\'s business activities. The audit will be conducted
        at sāf.ai\'s expense, except that if the audit discloses
        overpayments by sāf.ai or underpayments by Partner in excess of
        10% or \$2,000 (whichever is greater) over the period under
        review, then Partner (in addition to such other remedies as may
        be available at law and equity) shall reimburse sāf.ai for the
        reasonable, documented cost of such audit up to \$10,000, and
        the over-compensated party shall compensate the undercompensated
        party within 30 days of receiving the results of the audit.

7. Indemnification

    1. By Partner. Subject to 7.5, Partner (as \"Indemnitor\") shall
        defend and indemnify sāf.ai and its officers, employees,
        directors, agents and Affiliates (each as an \"Indemnitee\")
        from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, judgments,
        costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees)
        which sāf.ai may suffer or incur arising out of or in connection
        with (a) any action by a third party against sāf.ai that is
        based on a claim that any Partner Application or Customers\' use
        thereof, infringe or misappropriate such third party\'s
        Intellectual Property Rights; (b) any action by a third party
        (including a Customer) against sāf.ai relating to (i) a
        representation or warranty made by Partner to such third party
        (unless such representation or warranty was authorized in
        writing by sāf.ai) or (ii) any claim of unfair or deceptive
        business practices not arising directly from a statement
        expressly authorized by sāf.ai; (c) a breach of Partner\'s
        representations or warranties in this PPA or any applicable
        Addendum; or (d) any claim specified to subject to indemnity in
        an applicable Addendum.
    2. By sāf.ai. Subject to 7.5, sāf.ai (as \"Indemnitor\") shall
        defend and indemnify Partner and its officers, employees,
        directors, agents and Affiliates (each as an \"Indemnitee\")
        from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, judgments,
        costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees)
        which Partner may suffer or incur arising out of or in
        connection with any action by a third party against Partner
        arising directly from a claim by such third party that the
        sāf.ai Offerings or the sāf.ai Portal infringe or misappropriate
        such third party\'s Intellectual Property Right. The foregoing
        defense and indemnification obligations do not apply to the
        extent any infringement or misappropriation claim of any kind
        arises from: (i) the combination, operation or use of the sāf.ai
        Offerings with equipment, devices, software (including a Partner
        Application) or data (including without limitation your
        Confidential Information) not supplied by sāf.ai, if a claim
        would not have occurred but for such combination, operation use;
        or (ii) use of the sāf.ai Products or Services other than in
        accordance with this PPA and the TOS.
    3. Injunction. If your use of the sāf.ai Offerings is, or in
        sāf.ai\'s opinion is likely to be, enjoined due to the type of
        claim specified in Section 7.2(ii), then sāf.ai may at its sole
        option and expense: (i) replace or modify the sāf.ai Offerings
        to make them non-infringing and of equivalent
        functionality; (ii) procure for you the right to continue using
        the sāf.ai Offerings under the terms of this PPA; or (iii) if
        sāf.ai is unable to accomplish either (i) or (ii) despite using
        its reasonable efforts, terminate your rights and sāf.ai\'s
        obligation under this PPA with respect to such sāf.ai Offerings
        and refund to you any Program Fees relating to a period after
        the termination to the extent your rights under the applicable
        Addendum would not be able to be effected but for the use of the
        sāf.ai Offerings.
    4. Sole Remedy. SUBJECT TO SECTION 9.1 BELOW, THE FOREGOING
        SECTIONS 7.2 and 7.3 STATE THE ENTIRE OBLIGATION OF SAF.AI AND
        ITS LICENSORS WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED OR ACTUAL INFRINGEMENT
        OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BY THE
        sāf.ai Offerings.
    5. Conditions of Indemnification. As a condition to an
        Indemnitor\'s obligations under this Section 7, an Indemnitee
        will: (i) promptly notify the Indemnitor of the claim for which
        the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification; (ii) grant the
        Indemnitor sole control of the defense and settlement of the
        claim; (iii) provide the Indemnitor, at the Indemnitor\'s
        expense, with all assistance, information and authority
        reasonably required for the defense and settlement of the
        claim; (iv) preserve and will not waive legal, professional or
        any other privilege attaching to any of the records, documents,
        or other information in relation to such claim without prior
        notification of consent by the Indemnitor. The Indemnitor will
        not settle any claim that involves a remedy other than payment
        without the Indemnitee\'s prior written consent, which may not
        be unreasonably withheld or delayed. An Indemnitee has the right
        to retain counsel, at the Indemnitee\'s expense, to participate
        in the defense or settlement of any claim. The Indemnitor will
        not be liable for any settlement or compromise that an
        Indemnitee enters into without the Indemnitor\'s prior written
        consent.

        REVENUE THAT PARTNER MAY EARN AS A RESULT OF ITS ACTIONS UNDER
        THIS PPA.**

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

    1. Neither party\'s liability (i) for unpaid Fees, (ii) for death
        or personal injury caused by its negligence or the negligence of
        its employees or agents, (iii) for fraud or fraudulent
        misrepresentation, (iv) under the indemnities set forth in
        Section 7; (v) a breach by Partner of Section 4.3(h) (vi) for
        its grossly negligent conduct; or (vii) for any other liability
        that cannot be excluded or limited by law, is excluded or
        limited by this PPA.
    2. Subject to Section 9.1 above, neither party shall be liable
        under or in connection with this PPA to the other (whether for
        breach of contract, tort (including negligence), breach of
        statutory duty or otherwise) for (i) loss of profit or
        revenue, (ii) loss from damage to business or goodwill, (iii)
        loss of contracts, (iv) loss of customers, (v) device failure or
        malfunction, or (vi) any other indirect, incidental,
        consequential, or special loss, even if a party has been advised
        of the possibility of such losses occurring.
    3. Subject to Sections 9.1 and 9.2 above, the aggregate liability
        of either party, its employees and its and each of their
        Affiliates\' to the other party arising out of or in connection
        with this PPA (and whether such liability arises as a result of
        breach of contract, tort (including negligence), breach of
        statutory duty or otherwise) shall be limited in the aggregate
        in relation to all claims arising from, or in connection with,
        this PPA, to the Fees paid or payable under the applicable
        Addendum or Program Type in relation to which a dispute arises
        in respect of the relevant Contract Year (defined below), or, if
        no such Fees were payable, five thousand dollars (\$5,000). For
        the purpose of this Section 9.3, (i) if more than one claim
        arises from the same event or series of events, then all such
        claims shall be treated as one, which will be treated as having
        arisen on the date on which the first relevant claim arose
        and (ii) \"Contract Year\" means the relevant period of twelve
        months starting on the start date of the applicable Addendum or
        an anniversary thereof (as appropriate).
    4. Neither party may bring a claim or action against the other
        party, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence),
        breach of statutory duty, under an indemnity or otherwise,
        arising out of, or in connection with, this PPA more than
        one (1) year after the party knows, or should reasonably have
        known, of any event giving rise to the claim or cause of action.
    5. Each party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate any loss
        and damage it incurs in relation to any claim or action (whether
        based on an action or claim in contract, tort (including
        negligence), breach of statutory duty, under an indemnity or
        otherwise) which it brings against the other.
    6. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS SET OUT IN
        THIS SECTION 9 ARE REASONABLE, HAVING REGARD TO ALL THE RELEVANT
        CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE LEVELS OF RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EACH
        PARTY\'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

10. Confidential Information.

    1. Definition. \"Confidential Information\" means: any business or
        technical information disclosed by either party (\"Disclosing
        Party\") to the other (\"Receiving Party\") that is designated
        as confidential at the time of disclosure or that, under the
        circumstances, a person exercising reasonable business judgment
        would understand to be confidential or proprietary, including
        but not limited to: (i) any (a) business, commercial,
        operational, management or financial information, customer
        lists, price lists, data, processes, models, personnel data and
        any other data or know how; and any (b) analyses, compilations
        and other material prepared by the Receiving Party which
        contain, reflect or are generated from the information described
        in (b) above; (ii) any information that either party derives
        relating to the conduct or performance of the other party\'s
        personnel, services or systems, and any information that either
        party conveys to the other party concerning data security
        measures, incidents, or findings; (iii) the specific terms set
        forth in this PPA; and (iv) (m) all elements of the sāf.ai
        Offerings, including any non-public roadmap, (n) any sāf.ai
        Materials, and (o) the Fees, as well as any related discounts
        (each of which are considered to be sāf.ai\'s Confidential
        Information). Unless sāf.ai Materials are explicitly marked
        \'for distribution to Customers\' or as otherwise agreed by
        sāf.ai, sāf.ai Materials should be treated as Confidential
        Information not intended to be made public or shared with third
        parties.
    2. Exclusions. The obligations in Section 10.3 will not apply to
        the extent any information: (i) is or becomes generally known to
        the public through no fault of or breach of this PPA by the
        receiving party; (ii) is rightfully known by the receiving party
        at the time of disclosure without an obligation of
        confidentiality; (iii) is independently developed by the
        receiving party without use of the disclosing party\'s
        Confidential Information; or (iv) is rightfully obtained by the
        receiving party from a third party without restriction on use or
        disclosure.
    3. Use and Disclosure Restrictions. The Receiving Party will not
        use the Disclosing Party\'s Confidential Information except as
        necessary for the performance or enforcement of this PPA and
        will not disclose such Confidential Information to any third
        party except to those of its employees and subcontractors who
        have a bona fide need to know such Confidential Information for
        the performance or enforcement of this PPA; provided that each
        such employee and subcontractor is bound by a written agreement
        that contains use and disclosure restrictions consistent with
        the terms set forth in this Section. Each receiving party will
        protect the disclosing party\'s Confidential Information from
        unauthorized use and disclosure using efforts equivalent to the
        efforts that the receiving party ordinarily uses with respect to
        its own Confidential Information and in no event less than a
        reasonable standard of care. The foregoing obligations will not
        restrict either party from disclosing the other party\'s
        Confidential Information or the terms and conditions of this
        PPA: (i) pursuant to the order or requirement of a court,
        administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that
        the party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable
        prior notice to the other party to enable it to contest such
        order or requirement unless legally prohibited; (ii) on a
        confidential basis to its legal or professional financial
        advisors; (iii) as required under applicable securities
        regulations, provided that the party required to make such a
        disclosure gives reasonable prior notice to the other party
        unless legally prohibited; or (iv) on a confidential basis to
        present or future providers of venture capital and/or potential
        private investors in or acquirers of such party, provided that
        any such persons are bound by a written agreement that contains
        use and disclosure restrictions consistent with the terms set
        forth in this Section.
    4. Remedies. Any use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party\'s
        Confidential Information in a manner inconsistent with the
        provisions of this Agreement may cause the Disclosing Party
        irreparable damage for which remedies other than injunctive
        relief may be inadequate, and both parties agree that the
        Disclosing Party may request injunctive or other equitable
        relief seeking to restrain such use or disclosure.

11. Term and Termination.

    1. Term. This PPA will begin on the Effective Date and shall remain
        in effect until the later of one year from the Effective Date or
        the date upon which no Addendum remains outstanding between the
        parties, unless earlier terminated under this Agreement.

    2. Termination for Convenience.

        By sāf.ai. sāf.ai may terminate an Addendum or this PPA (i) for
        any reason or no reason upon at least thirty (30) days prior
        written notice; or (b) in case sāf.ai determines in its sole
        discretion that continuing to permit Partner to remain in a
        Partner Program would be detrimental to sāf.ai\'s brand,
        immediately on notice. For clarity, sāf.ai may terminate all
        Addenda and this PPA simultaneously in accordance with this
        paragraph.

        By Partner. Partner may terminate an Addendum or this PPA for
        any reason or no reason upon at least thirty (30) days prior
        written notice. For clarity, Partner may terminate all Addenda
        and this PPA simultaneously in accordance with this paragraph.

    3. Termination for Change of Control. sāf.ai may terminate this PPA
        upon notice to Partner if Partner undergoes a Change of Control
        (defined herein). For purposes of this PPA, \"Change of
        Control\" means a transaction or a series of related
        transactions: (i) in which one or more related parties that did
        not previously own or control at least a fifty percent (50%)
        equity interest in Partner obtains ownership or control of at
        least a fifty percent (50%) equity interest in Partner; (ii) in
        which Partner sells all or substantially all of its assets;
        or (iii) as a result of which one or more related parties that
        did not previously have the right or power to exercise a
        controlling influence over the management or policies of Partner
        acquires such a right or power, including, without limitation,
        the ability to elect a majority of Partner\'s board of directors
        or a similar governing body.

    4. Termination for Material Breach. In the event either party fails
        to cure a material breach of this PPA within thirty (30) days or
        such other period as agreed to in writing after receiving
        written notice thereof, then the non-breaching party may
        terminate this PPA upon written notice.

    5. Effect of Termination. Upon any termination of the PPA, except
        as described in an Addendum: (i) all licenses granted to Partner
        by sāf.ai hereunder will automatically cease; (ii) Partner will
        promptly return, or at sāf.ai\'s option, destroy all sāf.ai
        Materials, and all related documentation, except to the extent
        and only for so long as Partner continues to provide maintenance
        and support to Customers, as specified in an Addendum; (iii)
        Partner will immediately stop using the sāf.ai Marks and
        discontinue all representations that it is authorized to provide
        any services that Integrate with the sāf.ai Offerings; and (iv)
        each party will promptly return to the other all of the other
        party\'s Confidential Information within its possession or
        control, and will certify in writing that it has complied with
        its obligations to return all such Confidential Information.
        Except for a termination by sāf.ai for Partner\'s material
        breach (for which sāf.ai shall owe no further compensation),
        termination shall not affect any amounts owed to Partner that
        were owed and outstanding prior to termination. In addition,
        upon any termination of this PPA, the payment dates of all
        amounts due sāf.ai will automatically be accelerated so that
        they will become due and payable on the effective date of
        termination, even if longer terms had been provided previously.

    6. Survival. Notwithstanding any termination of any Addendum or
        this PPA, the provisions of SECTIONS 1, 4.2, 4.8, 6.6, 7, 8.5,
        9, 10, 11, and 12,inclusive along with all provisions of any
        Addendum that by their terms are intended to survive, shall
        survive.

12. Miscellaneous

    1. Relationship of Parties. Nothing contained in this PPA, nor in
        the relationship created thereby, shall be interpreted to
        evidence a joint venture, partnership, principal-agent
        relationship, or employer-employee relationship between Partner
        and sāf.ai. Neither party shall have any right or authority to
        act on behalf of, or incur any obligation for, the other party.
        Partner reserves the right to determine the manner, method and
        means by which services will be performed as well as set the
        hours of work and schedule that will be followed by Partner.
        Partner shall have sole responsibility for any and all U.S. and
        foreign national, state and local income taxes, unemployment
        insurance tax, social security tax, self-employment tax and
        other taxes and tax payment obligations with respect to payments
        made by sāf.ai pursuant to this PPA. Partner shall jointly and
        severally indemnify and hold sāf.ai harmless from any and all
        losses or liability (including reasonable attorneys\' fees)
        arising from Partner\'s failure to report as income payments
        received by it under this PPA and Partner\'s failure to withhold
        for national, state and local tax purposes amounts paid to
        Partner\'s approved employees, agents, contractors and other
        persons performing services pursuant to this PPA.
    2. Assignment. The rights and liabilities of the parties hereto
        shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective
        successors, heirs, executors and administrators, as the case may
        be; provided that Partner may not assign or delegate Partner\'s
        obligations under this PPA either in whole or in part without
        sāf.ai\'s prior written consent.
    3. Governing Law; Severability. This PPA shall be governed by and
        construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
        excluding that body of law applicable to choice of law. If any
        provision of this PPA is for any reason found by a court of
        competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the remainder of
        this PPA, or the Agreement that it is a part of, shall continue
        in full force and effect.
    4. Complete Understanding; Modification. This PPA (including all
        applicable Addenda) constitutes the entire agreement between the
        parties. It supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous
        understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such
        subject matter, and prevails over any conflicting terms or
        conditions contained on printed forms submitted with purchase
        orders, sales acknowledgments or quotations. This PPA may not be
        modified or waived, in whole or part, except in writing and
        signed by an officer or duly authorized representative of both
        parties, provided that sāf.ai may provide an updated version of
        this Agreement or any applicable Addendum at any time on notice
        (each, an \"Updated Agreement\"), which Updated Agreements shall
        be effective 30 days from the date sāf.ai makes it available to
        Partner (unless the notice specifies a longer period of time)
        (the \"Update Effective Date\"), and shall be deemed to be
        binding on Partner as of the Update Effective Date unless
        Partner sends a notice of termination prior to such date (which
        termination shall be effective as of such date).
    5. Notices. Any notices required or permitted hereunder shall be
        given to the appropriate party at the address specified on the
        first page hereof or at such other address as the party shall
        specify in writing, which may include email. Additionally,
        sāf.ai may provide any notices under this PPA by posting such
        notice in the Partner Portal. Such notice shall be deemed
        given (i) in the case of a posting in the Partner Portal, upon
        Partner\'s next log-in to the Partner Portal; (ii) in the case
        of email, upon delivery of the email provided that no error
        message is returned within 24 hours; or (iii) in the case of
        physical mail, upon personal delivery to the appropriate address
        or sent by certified or registered mail, three days after the
        date of mailing provided that notice of change of address shall
        be deemed effective only upon receipt.
    6. Headings. The titles and headings of the various sections and
        paragraphs in this PPA are intended solely for convenience of
        reference and are not intended to explain, modify or place any
        construction or limitation upon any of the provisions of this
        PPA.

        Partner without prior express written approval from sāf.ai.
