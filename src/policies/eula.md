    sāf.ai may terminate Licensee's license if Licensee materially

    Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, the rights and
    licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately
    terminate, and Licensee shall immediately cease using, and will
    destroy or render practically inaccessible, the Software,
    Documentation, and all other tangible items in Licensee's possession

    obligations of the parties set forth in Sections 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8
    shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for any
    reason.

5. CONFIDENTIALITY.

    \"**Confidential Information**\" shall mean the Software, all
    information regarding the Software (including any trade secrets,
    know-how, inventions, techniques, processes, and algorithms embodied
    in the Software), Documentation, any Updates, sāf.ai products,
    product road-maps, and other technical, business, financial and
    product development plans, forecasts and strategies, and other
    information provided by sāf.ai to Licensee under this Agreement,
    whether disclosed orally, in writing, or by examination or
    inspection, other than information that Licensee can demonstrate:

    i.  was already known to Licensee, other than under an obligation of
        confidentiality, at the time of disclosure;

    ii. was generally available in the public domain at the time of
        disclosure to Licensee;

    iii. became generally available in the public domain after
         disclosure other than through any act or omission of Licensee;

    iv. was subsequently lawfully disclosed to Licensee by a third party
        without any obligation of confidentiality; or (v) was
        independently developed by Licensee without use of or reference
        to any information or materials disclosed by sāf.ai or its
        suppliers.

    Licensee shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any
    third party except as expressly provided in this Agreement, and
    shall use at least the same degree of care that it uses to prevent
    the disclosure of its own confidential information of like
    importance, but in no event less than reasonable care, to prevent
    the disclosure of Confidential Information.

    If Licensee wishes to disclose to sāf.ai any information under the
    Agreement that Licensee considers proprietary or confidential to
    Licensee ("**Licensee Information**"), then Licensee agrees such
    disclosure will be governed by a separate non-disclosure agreement
    ("**NDA**") by and between the parties.

    If Licensee is required to disclose Confidential Information by
    applicable law or court order, Licensee shall notify sāf.ai of the
    required disclosure promptly in writing and shall cooperate with
    sāf.ai in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of the
    required disclosure. Licensee shall not use any Confidential
    Information for any purpose other than as expressly authorized under
    this Agreement. In no event shall Licensee use the Software or any
    Confidential Information to develop, manufacture, market, sell, or
    distribute any product or service, including any sāf.ai products
    except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

    Licensee acknowledges that damages due to Licensee's improper
    disclosure of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm
    and that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate sāf.ai
    for any breach of this Agreement. The parties agree that sāf.ai
    shall be entitled to relief both at law and in equity, including
    injunctive relief and specific performance, in the event of any
    non-permitted disclosure or threatened non-permitted disclosure
    without proof of any actual or special damages and without the
    requirement that sāf.ai post a bond or other surety in connection
    with any such injunctive relief. Licensee acknowledges and agrees
    that any breach or threatened breach of the confidentiality
    provisions of this Agreement would be a material breach of this
    Agreement.

6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER. sāf.ai warrants that for a period
    of ninety (90) days from installation the Software will perform
    substantially in accordance with the Documentation ("Warranty").
    Licensee's exclusive remedy and sāf.ai's entire obligation liability
    for any breach of the Warrantee is to repair or replace the software
    or refund to Licensee the price Licensee paid for the Software if a
    repair or replacement of the Software would, in sāf.ai's opinion, be
    unreasonable. The Warranty is conditioned upon Licensee providing
    sāf.ai with prompt written notice of the failure of the Software to
    perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation.

    The Warranty shall not apply if (i) the Software is not used in
    accordance with the Documentation or this Agreement; (ii) any part
    of the Software has been modified by any entity other than sāf.ai;
    or (iii) a malfunction in the Software has been caused by any
    equipment or software not supplied by sāf.ai.

    **EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTY, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITH
    ALL FAULTS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SĀF.AI MAKES NO OTHER
    REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND REGARDING THE SOFTWARE AND
    DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES, OR EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING the IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR SYSTEMS INTEGRATION. SĀF.AI
    MAKES NO WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR GUARANTEE AS TO THE SOFTWARE'S
    USE OR PERFORMANCE, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE
    FAIL-SAFE, UNINTERRUPTED OR FREE FROM ERRORS OR DEFECTS**.

    **THE SOFTWARE MAY FAIL AND IS NOT DESIGNED, DEVELOPED, TESTED, OR
    INTENDED FOR USE IN OR WITH HIGH-RISK SYSTEMS REQUIRING FAILSAFE
    PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, VEHICLE
    NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEMS, OR OTHER
    SYSTEMS IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO
    DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.
    SĀF.AI HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND LICENSEE SHALL INDEMNIFY AND
    HOLD HARMLESS SĀF.AI FROM, ALL CLAIMS, SUITS, DEMANDS, AND
    PROCEEDINGS ALLEGING, CLAIMING, SEEKING, OR ASSERTING ANY LIABILITY,
    LOSS, OBLIGATION, RISK, COST, DAMAGE, AWARD, PENALTY, SETTLEMENT,
    JUDGMENT, FINE, OR EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES) ARISING FROM
    OR IN CONNECTION WITH LICENSEE'S USE OF THE SOFTWARE ON OR IN A
    HIGH-RISK SYSTEM**.

    **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. FOR THE BASE VERSION, EACH PARTY'S ENTIRE
    AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR CLAIMS UNDER OR RELATED
    TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL
    PAYMENTS PAID OR PAYABLE BY LICENSEE TO SĀF.AI IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS
    PRIOR TO THE CLAIM. FOR THE COMMUNITY EDITION, EACH PARTY'S ENTIRE
    AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR CLAIMS UNDER OR RELATED
    TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED
    DOLLARS (\$100 USD). TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO
    EVENT SHALL LICENSEE OR SĀF.AI OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE LIABILITY FOR
    ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES OR
    DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR
    LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
    LIABILITY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, STATUTE, CONTRACT OR
    OTHER), EVEN IF SĀF.AI AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY
    NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED
    REMEDY. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS DUE
    TO SĀF.AI IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT WERE TAKEN
    INTO ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN
    THIS SECTION 6. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THIS LIMITATION IS
    AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT SĀF.AI WOULD NOT
    ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS ON ITS
    LIABILITY**.

7. INDEMNIFICATION

    Licensee shall indemnify and defend sāf.ai and its officers,
    directors, employees, contractors, agents, and affiliates against
    all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including court costs and
    reasonable attorney fees, as a result of or in connection with

    i)  Licensee's failure to obtain any consent, authorization, or
        license required for sāf.ai's use or handling of data, software,
        materials, systems, networks, or the technology provided by
        Licensee;

    ii) Licensee's use of the Software in a manner not expressly
        permitted by this Agreement including any manner inconsistent
        with the Documentation;

    iii) any violation by Licensee of applicable laws; *and*

    iv) any reasonable costs and attorney fees required for sāf.ai to
        respond to a subpoena, court order, or other official government
        inquiry regarding Licensee's use of the Software.

    sāf.ai shall indemnify and defend Licensee against third party
    claims asserted against Licensee in a suit or action for direct
    patent infringement, direct copyright infringement, or direct trade
    secret misappropriation.

    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, sāf.ai
    shall not indemnify or defend Licensee for claims asserted, in whole
    or in part, against

    i)  technology, designs, or requirements given by Licensee to
        sāf.ai, *or*

    ii) any modification to the Software made by anyone other than
        sāf.ai.

    sāf.ai may, at its sole discretion and at its own expense, with
    respect to any Software that is subject to a claim

    i)  procure Licensee with the right to continue using the Software;

    ii) replace the Software with a non-infringing version of the
        Software; *or*

    iii) modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing.

    Promptly upon learning of any claim for which indemnification is
    sought from the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall
    notify the indemnifying party of such claim and shall furnish to the
    indemnifying party all information known and reasonably available to
    the indemnified party related to such claim; provided that any
    failure to comply with the provisions of this clause shall not
    relieve the indemnifying party of its indemnification obligations
    except to the extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced
    the indemnifying party. Through counsel of its own choosing, the
    indemnified party has the right to participate in (but not control
    the defense of) any proceeding in which it is being indemnified
    under this Agreement, but in such event the indemnified party will
    be solely responsible for paying the legal fees and expenses for its
    own counsel. The indemnifying party will, however, continue to be
    solely responsible for all other expenses relating to the action,
    including legal fees and expenses of the counsel it selects to
    defend the claims. The indemnifying party shall not take any action,
    which unreasonably exposes the indemnified party to a risk of
    damages, which would not be covered by such indemnity, and may not
    settle any matter without the prior written consent of the
    indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
    conditioned or delayed.

        valid unless in writing signed by each party specifying the
